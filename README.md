## Synopsis
Program **GNU D'EPRnian** (under the GPLv3 license)
This program alows you to analyze EPR spectra (electron paramagnetic resonance)
---
### Program futures: 
1. View spectra
1. Converting spectra to ASCII column data format
1. Subtracting **_base-line_**
1. Appling **_smooth filter_**
1. Creating **_regions_** and manipulate them by mouse
1. Automatic **_peak searching_** and automatic peak's parameter calculation
1. Creating **_set of curves_** which are under processing
1. Creating **_table of curves/regions_** parameter values (G-factor, peak width, peak area etc.)
1. Possibility to copy data from table by mouse selection and Ctrl+C

## Motivation

At the present days there is a big problem to find simple viewer for EPR data. This program should help you to do a first step in electron paramagnetic resonance data processing.

## Installation

Copy project folder to your computer and from MATLAB's editor open and run DEPRNIAN.m file then select "Change folder"

MATLAB version should be greater than **_MATLAB 2015a_**
